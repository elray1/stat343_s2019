* Introduction; review of topics from probability; properties of the sample mean for a simple random sample from a finite populaiton
 
#### Wed, Jan 23

 * **In class**, we will work on: Overview and review
    * Discuss [syllabus](syllabus/syllabus_stat_343.pdf), overview of course
    * Review of prerequisites
        * Topics from probability: [pdf](resources/probability/probability.pdf) (also posted on resources page)
        * Practice examples for probability: [pdf](materials/20180123_probability/probability_practice.pdf)
        * Common probability distributions: [pdf](resources/probability/probability_distributions.pdf) (also posted on resources page; you don't need to memorize this material)
        * Topics from calculus (not discussed today, please review after class): [pdf](resources/calculus/calculus.pdf) (also posted on resources page)
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * **Register for GitHub** [here](https://github.com) if you haven't already; I will ask you to provide your GitHub user name in the questionairre below.
    * **Fill out** a brief [questionnairre](https://goo.gl/forms/qFlzOcikqxAkDrJE2)
    * **Fill out** this brief [poll about when my office hours should be held](http://whenisgood.net/n4ahdz3)
    * **Sign up** for our class at Piazza (anonymous question and answer forum): [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2019/stat343](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2019/stat343)
    * **Reading**
        * Review the prerequisite material from probability and calculus.  If there are any topics from probability or calculus that you don't have memorized, please start memorizing them.  This will make the rest of this class go much more smoothly for you.  If you have any questions on this material, please don't hesitate to ask me in office hours or on Piazza.  I am happy to help with this material.
        * Over the next few classes we will cover material from Sections 7.1 - 7.3 of the text.  Give those sections in the book a brief skim.
    * **Homework 0** due Wed, Jan 30

#### Fri, Jan 25
 * **In class**, we will work on: Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3.1, and 7.3.2 (mostly lecture)
    * Definitions: population parameter, statistic, estimator, estimate, simple random sample, sampling distribution, bias, variance, mean squared error
    * Expected value, variance, and MSE of the sample mean based on a simple random sample from a finite population.
    * Estimating the population variance based on a simple random sample from a finite population.
    * Set up git on RStudio (if you took Stat 340 with me, you can leave early)
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * Start memorizing any definitions from today's class that you don't know yet.
    * **Problem Set 0** due Wed, Jan 30
