* Introduction; review of topics from probability; properties of the sample mean for a simple random sample from a finite populaiton
 
#### Wed, Jan 23

 * **In class**, we will work on: Overview and review
    * Discuss [syllabus](syllabus/syllabus_stat_343.pdf), overview of course
    * Review of prerequisites
        * Topics from probability: [pdf](resources/probability/probability.pdf) (also posted on resources page)
        * Practice examples for probability: [pdf](materials/20180123_probability/probability_practice.pdf)
        * Common probability distributions: [pdf](resources/probability/probability_distributions.pdf) (also posted on resources page; you don't need to memorize this material)
        * Topics from calculus (not discussed today, please review after class): [pdf](resources/calculus/calculus.pdf) (also posted on resources page)
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * **Register for GitHub** [here](https://github.com) if you haven't already; I will ask you to provide your GitHub user name in the questionairre below.
    * **Fill out** a brief [questionnairre](https://goo.gl/forms/qFlzOcikqxAkDrJE2)
    * **Fill out** this brief [poll about when my office hours should be held](http://whenisgood.net/n4ahdz3)
    * **Sign up** for our class at Piazza (anonymous question and answer forum): [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2019/stat343](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2019/stat343)
    * **Reading**
        * Review the prerequisite material from probability and calculus.  If there are any topics from probability or calculus that you don't have memorized, please start memorizing them.  This will make the rest of this class go much more smoothly for you.  If you have any questions on this material, please don't hesitate to ask me in office hours or on Piazza.  I am happy to help with this material.
        * Over the next few classes we will cover material from Sections 7.1 - 7.3 of the text.  Give those sections in the book a brief skim.
    * **Homework 0** due Wed, Jan 30

#### Fri, Jan 25
 * **In class**, we will work on: Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3.1, and 7.3.2 (mostly lecture)
    * Last two probability examples from last class
    * Briefly talk through the \"common probability distributions\" handout
    * Motivating example for Chapter 7: [pdf](materials/20180125_srs/srs_hospitals.pdf)
    * Definitions from Chapter 7 (some on motivating example handout): population parameter, statistic, estimator, estimate, simple random sample, sampling distribution, bias, variance, mean squared error
    * Start on some derivations of the expected value, variance, and MSE of the sample mean based on a simple random sample from a finite population.
    * If time (unlikely), start on estimating the population variance based on a simple random sample from a finite population.
    * Lecture notes for Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3.1, and 7.3.2: [pdf](materials/20180125_srs/lecture_notes.pdf)
    * Set up git on RStudio (if you took Stat 340 with me, you can leave early)
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * Start memorizing any definitions from today's class that you don't know yet.
    * **Problem Set 0** due Wed, Jan 30

#### Mon, Feb 4
 * **In Class**, we will work on: Section 7.3.3
    * A first look at confidence intervals for a population mean based on a simple random sample.  [pdf](materials/20190204_srs_ci_lecture_notes/20190204_lecture_notes.pdf)  (not on the lecture notes but discussed in class are the coverage probability and nominal coverage probability of a confidence interval)

    * If you finish early, free time or work on homework
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * **Problem Set 1** due Fri, Feb 15

#### Fri, Feb 8
 * **In Class**, we will work on: Start on Sections 8.1 through 8.5
    * Introductory worksheet, friend or foe: [pdf](materials/20190208_mle/20180208_mle_friend_or_foe.pdf)

    * Defined the likelihood function, log-likelihood function, maximum likelihood estimator, maximum likelihood estimate
    * Argued that the parameter value that maximizes the log-likelihood also maximizes the likelihood, since log is an increasing function.
    * Reviewed some calculus related to finding a maximum of a univariate function
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * **Problem Set 1** due Fri, Feb 15
