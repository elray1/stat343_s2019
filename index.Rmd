**Instructor:** Evan Ray

**Email:** eray@mtholyoke.edu

**Office:** Clapp 404C

**Office Hours:** Regularly scheduled office hours at times to be determined.  These are times I guarantee I will be in my office and available, but that should **not** be interpreted as indicating that these are the only times I'm willing to meet.  Please do not hesitate to contact me to set up appointments for additional office hours at any time!!

**Piazza:** We have a Piazza page at [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2019/stat343](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2019/stat343).  You can ask and answer questions there, anonymously if you want, and everyone in the class will be able to see and contribute to the answers.
