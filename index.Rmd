Clapp 416 has been reserved and will be open for you to work together on Tuesday evenings.  If it would be helpful to have another space or time reserved, let me know and we can set that up.

**Piazza:** We have a Piazza page at [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2019/stat343](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2019/stat343).  You can ask and answer questions there, anonymously if you want, and everyone in the class will be able to see and contribute to the answers.
