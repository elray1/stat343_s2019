```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

For each of the following numeric quantities, write down two intervals:

 * a 50% interval: you think there is a 50% probability that the quantity lies in this interval
 * a 90% interval: you think there is a 90% probability that the quantity lies in this interval

The person with the best calibrated intervals wins (for example, if 5 of your 50% intervals and 9 of your 90\% intervals contain the truth, you're doing great).
